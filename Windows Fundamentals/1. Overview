- Microsoft Windows started as a GUI on top of MS-DOS (1985) and evolved through many releases (NT, 2000, XP, 7, 10, 11).
- Windows Server editions (NT, 2000, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2019+) added:
  - Centralized management (Active Directory, Group Policy, MMC)
  - Web, file, and application services
  - Virtualization (Hyper-V), clustering, and security features
- Each version has a specific version number (e.g. 5.1 = XP, 6.1 = 7, 10.0 = 10/Server 2016+).
- Older/legacy versions become unsupported and are common sources of risk in real environments.

Security takeaway:
-Running out-of-support Windows (old desktop or server versions) increases exposure to known vulnerabilities (e.g. SMBv1/EternalBlue)
-Being able to quickly identify Windows versions helps assess exposure to known vulnerabilities and missing patches.
