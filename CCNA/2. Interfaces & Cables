Ethernet is a collection of network protocols/standards.

Network protocols are necessary to ensure interoperability between devices from different vendors or platforms. This results in vendor neutrality. Also, it is useful for
modularity via layers, that is, upgrade por modify parts without breaking others. Lastly, promotes sacalability and troubleshooting because knowing what each layer/protocol 
handles lets one isolate faults quickly.

Transmission Types include analog and digital.
Analog: uses continuous signals to represent information. e.g. In traditional radio broadcasts.
Digital: uses discrete signals (bits) to encode data.

Transmission Modes: Simplex, Haf-duples, and Full-duplex.
Simplex: allows one-way communication only where signals travel in a single direction. e.g. keyboard to a computer.
Half-Duplex: allows two-way communication but not simultaneously
Full-duplex: allows two-way communication simultaneouly.

Connections between network devices operate at a defined speed measured in bits per second.
A bit is a vlue represented by either 0 or 1.
A byte is 8 bits.

1 kilobit (kb) = 1,000 bits
1 megabit (Mb) = 1,000,000 bits
1 gigabit (Gb) = 1,000,000,000 bits
1 terabit (Tb) = 1,000,000,000,000 bits

Ethernet Standards are defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard. (1983)
IEEE = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

Speed    --   Common Name   -- IEEE Standard -- Informal Name -- Max Length
10 Mbps  --     Ethernet    --   802.3i    -- 10BASE-T        -- 100m
100 Mbps -- Fast Ethernet   --   802.3u    -- 100BASE-T       -- 100m
1 Gbps   --   Gig Ethernet  --   802.3ab   -- 1000BASE-T      -- 100m
10 Gbps  -- 10 Gig Ethernet --   802.3an   -- 10GBASE-T       -- 100m
