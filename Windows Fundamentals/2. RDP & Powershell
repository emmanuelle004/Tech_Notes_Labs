Remote vs Local Access

- Local access: interacting directly with the machine (keyboard, mouse, screen).
- Remote access: interacting with the machine over the network.
- Common remote access technologies:
  - VPN, SSH, VNC, WinRM, FTP

#Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

- Client/server model:
  - Client connects to a target IP/hostname where RDP is enabled.
  - Default port: TCP 3389.
- Allows full interactive desktop as if physically at the machine.
- In secure environments: restrict by firewall/VPN, use strong auth and proper certificates.

Typical command from linux:

xfreerdp /v:<target-ip> /u:<username> /p:<password>
xfreerdp3 /v:<target-ip> /u:<username> /p:<password>

PowerShell / WMI: Identifying the OS

Used PowerShell’s 'Get-WmiObject' to query Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):

powershell
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | Select Version, BuildNumber

Security Takeaway

RDP:
Exposed or weakly protected RDP is a common attack vector (brute force, credential stuffing, lateral movement).
Proper hardening (VPN, firewall rules, MFA, monitoring logon events) is essential.

OS Enumeration
Knowing how to quickly identify OS version and build helps:
Assess patch level and legacy risk.
Prioritize systems that may be vulnerable (e.g. outdated builds, unsupported versions).
