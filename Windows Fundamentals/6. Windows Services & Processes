Services allow for the creation and management of long-running processes.
Window services can be started at system boot with no intervention and can continue to run in the background even after the user logs out of their account.
Applications such as network monitoring apps can be created to install as a service.

Within Windows, services are responsible for:
- networking functions
- performing system diagnostics
-managing users credentials
-controlling Windows updates, etc.

Windows services are managed via the Service Control Manager (SCM) system accessible via:
-services.msc MMC add-in which provides a GUI interface for displaying, interacting, and managing services.
-sc.exe using PowerShell cmdlets such as Get-Service.

e.g 

Service statuses = Running, Stopped, or Paused.
Services can be set to start manually, automatically, or on a delay at system boot.
