Objective:
Understand the layout of the Windows boot drive to know where the OS lives, where applications store data, and where to look for potential evidence or misconfigurations.

Key directories on C:\

-C:\ – Root/boot partition, contains core system folders and files.
-C:\PerfLogs – Used for performance logs; often empty by default but can contain useful data for troubleshooting or analysis.
-C:\Program Files – On 64-bit systems: 64-bit applications. On 32-bit systems, all 16-bit and 32-bit programs are installed here. 
-C:\Program Files (x86) – 32-bit and 16-bit programs are installed here on 64-bit editions of Windows.
-C:\ProgramData – Hidden, machine-wide application data accessible to all users; often used for configs, databases, and service data.
-C:\Users – User profiles.
-Default – Template for new user profiles.
-Public – Shared files for all users; can also be shared over the network.
Each user has an AppData folder:
-Roaming – Follows the user (for example, in domain environments); app settings.
-Local – Machine-specific data such as caches and large files.
-LocalLow – Similar to Local but lower integrity; often used by sandboxed apps or browsers.
C:\Windows – Core operating system files.
C:\Windows\System32 and C:\Windows\SysWOW64 – Critical executables and DLLs used by Windows and applications.
C:\Windows\WinSxS – Component store holding versions of system components and updates (useful for servicing and patching).

Commands used:

dir C:\ /a
tree "C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware"

Security takeaway:
-Knowing these default locations helps you quickly find sensitive data, configs, logs, and binaries.
-PerfLogs, ProgramData, Public, and some AppData paths can be used for logging, staging, or abuse; they’re places to check for suspicious files.
-Weak or misconfigured NTFS permissions on these folders can enable unauthorized access, persistence, or privilege escalation.
-Recognizing what is normal makes it easier to spot out-of-place artifacts.
