Remote vs Local Access

- Local access: interacting directly with the machine (keyboard, mouse, screen).
- Remote access: interacting with the machine over the network.
- Common remote access technologies:
  - VPN, SSH, VNC, WinRM, FTP

#Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

- Client/server model:
  - Client connects to a target IP/hostname where RDP is enabled.
  - Default port: TCP 3389.
- Allows full interactive desktop as if physically at the machine.
- In secure environments: restrict by firewall/VPN, use strong auth and proper certificates.

Typical command from linux:

xfreerdp /v:<target-ip> /u:<username> /p:<password>
xfreerdp3 /v:<target-ip> /u:<username> /p:<password>

PowerShell / WMI: Identifying the OS

Used PowerShell’s 'Get-WmiObject' to query Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI):

powershell
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | Select Version, BuildNumber
