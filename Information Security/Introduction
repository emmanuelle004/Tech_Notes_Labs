#Information Security (Info Sec)
#Pillars of information security.

#What is Information Security?
Information security is the practice of protecting an invaluable asset from threats (destruction, theft or corruption), while maintaining the 
asset accessibility to its intended users.

Info sec is holistic, i.e., covers all layers of the system (all parts are interconnected)
Physical -- Technological -- Policies & Procedures.

#Pillars of Info Sec
-CIA Triad
-AAA
-Non-repudiation

1. Confidentiality
Information is should be kept secret, i.e., not disclosed or made available to anyone who is not authorized, whether data is in transit or at rest.
Typical controls: access controls, encryption, database views.

2. Integrity
Information and systems should not be tampered with and should be modified only by authorized procedures.
Integrity check: add redundancy to data/messages.
Techniques: hashing, checksums, MACs.

3. Availability
Systems, services, and data should be accessible and usable on demand by authorized users or entities.
Techniques: redundancy, capacity planning, backups & disaster recovery, fault tolerant designs.

4. Authentication
Verifying the identity of a user/process/device.
Factors: Something you know, are, have.
---Desirable properties: 
a. Unforgeable: an individual shouldn't be able to create a credential or response that a verifier will accept unless they possess the real secret.
b. Unguessable: The secret should have enough entropy that brute-force or prediction is infeasible.
c. Revocable: A credential or binding can quickly be invalidated when lost, stolen, or no longer needed.

-Something You Know
Pros: Simple to implement and understand.
Cons: Easy to crack (unless strong), might be resused several times.
OTPs are strong, but difficult to remember all of them.

-Something You Have: suthentication strength depends on difficulty of forging.
E.g. OTP Cards(e.g. Secure ID) generates new password each time user logs in, Smard Card: tamper-resistant, stores secret info, entered into a card-reader,
Token/key(i.e. iButton), ATM card.

-Something You Are
Pros: raises the bar.
Cons: key management, social acceptance, false positive (authentic user rejected), false negative (imposter accepted).

2FA:Verifies idendity based on 2 different authentication factors.

--Who authenticates who? 
-Person-to-computer
-Computer-to-computer

Types of authentication (e.g. SSL)
-Client: server verifies cleint's ID
-Server: client verifies serves's ID
-Mutual: Client and server verify each other.

Note: Authenticated user is referred to as 'principal'.

5. Authorization
Verifies whether a user has permission to conduct or perform some action on some resource.
Authority: what the pprincipal is allowed to do.
-ACL: Mechanism used by many OSs to determine whether users are authorized to conduct/perform certain actions.

6. Accountability
Record the actions of a user (what, where, where).
-Uses logging and audit trails.
Requirements: secure timestamping(OS & network), data integrity in logs and audit trails (one should not be able to modifiy trails or changes in trails should be detected)

7. Non-Repudiation
Undeniability of a transaction i.e. a party cannot credibly deny a specific action.
-Generate digitally signed statements 9evidence/receipts).
