Basic definitions

1. Computer network is the interconnection between two or more devices for the purpose of sharing resources.
2. Node is any device on a network that can send, receive, or forward data. e.g. PC, server, router, printer.
3. Server is a node that provides services or functionality to a client.
4. Client is a node that accesses services or functionalities made available by a server. 

Network devices:
1. Switches are Layer 2 devices that connect multiple devices in a local area network(LAN). Switches forward frames based on the MAC addresses of the devices.
e.g. Cisco Catalyst 9200 Switch.

Characteristics of switches:
-Have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts connections. (usually 24+)
-Provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN
-Do not provide connectivity between LANs

2. Routers are Layer 3 devices that forward packets between different networks or subsets. Routers forward packets based on IP addresses.
e.g. ISR 1000, ISR 900, ISR 4000.

Characteristics of routers:
-Have fewer network interfaces than switches.
-Are used to provide connectivity between LANs.
Used to send data over the internet.

3. Firewalls are security devices (hardware or software) that monitor and control network traffic based on a set of pre-defined rules, that is, they filter 
traffic between networks.
e.g. ASA5500-X, Firepower 2100.

There are two types:
-Network firewalls: hardware devices that filter traffic between networks,
-Host-based firewalls: software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC.

Characristics of Firewalls:
-Monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules.
-Can be placed inside or outside of the network.
-are knoen as Next-Generation Firewalls when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities.

4. Hub (legacy): Layer 1, repeats everything out all ports. No MAC learning. One big collision domain.

5. Wireless Access Point (AP): Connects wireless clients to the wired network.

6. IDS/IPS:
IDS: monitors traffic and alerts.
IPS: monitors and can block traffic inline
