Objective:
Understand common Windows file systems and how NTFS permissions work so I can evaluate access control, misconfigurations, and potential attack paths.

Windows File System Types

FAT12 / FAT16
-Legacy; not used on modern Windows installations.

FAT32
-Common on USB drives, SD cards, and older systems.
-Uses 32-bit entries in the file allocation table.
Pros:
-Very compatible across devices (PCs, consoles, cameras, etc.).
-Works with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Cons:
-Max file size: 4 GB.
-No built-in permissions, encryption, or journaling.
-Not suitable for securing sensitive data.

exFAT
-Designed mainly for flash storage.
-Better limits than FAT32, widely supported.
-Also lacks NTFS-style security and journaling.

NTFS (New Technology File System)
-Default for modern Windows (since Windows NT).
Pros:
-Reliable; supports recovery and consistency after failures (journaling).
-Granular permissions on files and folders.
-Supports very large partitions and files.
-Supports features like compression, encryption (EFS), quotas.
Cons:
-Not fully supported by many embedded/media devices.
-Less convenient for pure plug-and-play between all consumer devices.

NTFS Permissions

-Full Control
Read, write, change permissions, take ownership, delete.

-Modify
Read, write, delete.

-Read and Execute
View contents and execute files.

-List Folder Contents
View and list folders/subfolders (folders only).

-Read and Execute
View files and list folder contents as well as executing files.

-Write
Create files/folders and write to files.

-Traverse Folder
Move through a folder to access a file or subfolder even if listing is not allowed.

Important concepts:

Note:
-Files and folders usually inherit permissions from their parent.
-Inheritance can be disabled to set explicit permissions.

Effective access:
-Determined by combining allow/deny entries from user and group memberships.

Basic access flags often seen:
F : Full access
M : Modify
RX: Read and execute
R : Read
W : Write
D : Delete
N : No access

Using icacls 
-icacls allows viewing and modifying NTFS permissions from the command line.

Examples:

View permissions on C:\Windows:
command = icacls C:\Windows

Sample output line show Which users/groups have which permissions.

Inheritance flags such as:
(CI): container inherit (subfolders)
(OI): object inherit (files)
(IO): inherit only
(I): inherited from parent

Example: granting a user (joe) full control on C:\Users (non-recursive):
command = icacls C:\Users /grant joe:F

Example: removing joe’s permissions:
command = icacls C:\Users /remove joe

Summary:

icacls can:
-Grant/deny permissions.
-Control inheritance.
-Change ownership.
-It is useful on both standalone machines and in domain environments for fine-grained access control.

Security Takeaway

Choosing NTFS over FAT32/exFAT on Windows systems is essential for:
-Proper access control
-Auditing
-Resilience (journaling)

Misconfigured NTFS permissions can lead to:
-Unauthorized data access
-Lateral movement, that is, gmoving from one system to another inside the network, usually reusing or abusing gained crednetials.
-Privilege escalation, that is, gaining higher permissions on the same system or within the same account context.
