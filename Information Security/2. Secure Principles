#Security Principles

1. Defense in Depth
One should not rely on a single protection mechanism, since they are all inclined to fail i.e. defenses should be complementary (preventive, detective, reponsive).
Best practice: use a layer of defenses which limit the chance of initial foothold escalate into the full compromise.

2. Fail-Safe Defaults
Absence of explicit permission is equivalent to no permission.
Best practice: Systems should be secure "out-of-the-box".

3. Secure the Weakest Link
A system is only as strong as its weakest link (most vulnerable, easy to attack).
Best practice: Identify and harden third-party/trust boundaries.

4. Complete Mediation
Every access to every resource must be checked for authorization.
Best practice: Check permissions on every use.

5. Open Design
A system should be secure even if the adversary knows everything about its design and implementation.
Best practice: Use public, well-analyzed primitves and assume adversaries know your design.

6. Separation of Privilege
Privilege, or authority should only be granted to subjects who require it. 
Best practice: Require independent approvals or multi-factor controls where high-impact actions occur.

7. Least Privilege
Subject should possess only the required level of privilege required to perform a specific task or duty.
Best Practice: Fine-grained roles and auditing privileged access.

8. Work Factor - how much work an attacker has to do(time, computation, money, skill) to break a system.
Increase the difficulty of mounting attacks. E.g. incorporate non-determinism/randomness (system behaves less predictably e.g. ASLR), 
in crypto: increase key length.
Best practice: long keys, salted hash, or rate limits while balancing with usability.
Drawback: Decreases usability.

9. Compromise Reading
Concede(understand) that attacks will occur, but record the fact.
Best practice: loggign and retention need to be paired with monitoring and response playbooks.

10. Logging
Log everything.
Best practice: Design tamper-evident, remote, and redundant logging pipelines and practice log-driven incident response/
